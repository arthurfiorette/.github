## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures. If you discover a
security vulnerability in our software or services, please report it promptly via email at
[security@arthur.place](mailto:security@arthur.place).

To help us investigate and address the issue efficiently, please include the following
details in your report:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any potential impact you have identified
- (Optional) Suggested mitigations or fixes

We kindly ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had an
opportunity to address it.

## Response Process

### Investigation & Validation

Our security team will investigate the reported issue and may contact you for additional
information or clarification.

### Resolution & Patch Deployment

If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will prioritize a fix based on its severity and
impact. While resolution times may vary, we strive to release patches as quickly as
possibleâ€”typically within a few days of confirmation.

### Responsible Disclosure

Once a fix has been implemented and deployed, we may coordinate a public disclosure if
necessary. We appreciate your cooperation in keeping vulnerability details private until
we have resolved the issue.
