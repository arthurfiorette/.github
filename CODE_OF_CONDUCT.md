# Code of Conduct

<br />

## Philosophy

This project prioritizes correctness, security, and long-term maintainability over
consensus or comfort. Technical decisions involve explicit tradeoffs, and disagreement is
expected—but only when argued in good faith, with context, and respect for the constraints
under which the project operates. Absolutist thinking, performative debate, or low-signal
criticism is treated as noise and will be removed. Participation here is a privilege, not
an entitlement.

<br />

## Expected Behavior

All participants must:

- **Remain strictly professional** Communication must be factual, technical, and focused
  on the project.

- **Assume good faith, demonstrate competence** Disagreement must acknowledge the likely
  rationale behind existing decisions.

- **Respect maintainer authority** Maintainers set direction, scope, and priorities. These
  are not up for debate.

- **Optimize for signal** Avoid repetition, bikeshedding, rhetorical arguments, or
  meta-discussion.

- **Comply when corrected** Failure to adjust behavior after moderation is grounds for
  removal.

<br />

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following will result in moderation action:

- Personal attacks, insults, harassment, or trolling
- Discriminatory, exclusionary, or hostile language
- Sexualized content or unwelcome advances
- Publishing private, identifying, or sensitive information
- Bad-faith arguments, absolutist security claims, or refusal to engage with tradeoffs
- Sustained disruption, derailing, or time-wasting behavior
- Any conduct inconsistent with a professional engineering environment

<br />

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies **to all @arthurfiorette's GitHub repositories**, including:

- Issues, pull requests, discussions, reviews, and comments
- Any interaction using GitHub features under this project or its official forks

<br />

## Enforcement

Enforcement follows GitHub’s moderation model and is entirely at the discretion of the
maintainers.

Maintainers may:

- **Hide, edit, lock, or delete content**
- **Issue warnings**
- **Close issues or pull requests**
- **Block or ban users from the repository**
- **Report behavior to GitHub Trust & Safety**

No justification beyond this policy is required. Decisions may be final.

<br />

## Reporting

All Code of Conduct violations must be handled **through GitHub**:

- Use GitHub’s **“Report content”** feature where available
- For severe cases, maintainers may escalate directly to **GitHub Trust & Safety**

Do **not** open meta-issues to contest moderation actions. Retaliation against reporters
will result in immediate removal.
