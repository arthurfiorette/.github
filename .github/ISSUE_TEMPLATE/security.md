## ðŸ‘® Responsible Disclosure

Do not open issues that might have security implications. It is critical that security
related issues are reported privately so we have time to address them before they become
public knowledge.

Please read our
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/arthurfiorette/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) before
reporting a vulnerability.

Vulnerabilities can also be reported by emailing
[security@arthur.place](mailto:security@arthur.place).
